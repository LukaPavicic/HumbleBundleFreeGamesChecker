# HumbleBundleFreeGamesChecker
Run this program to see if there are any free games on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/" target="_blank">Humble Bundle</a>

This program is very simple and probably not the best way to do it, but it works.

<b>This program works in this way:</b>
  1.Gets the source code from https://www.humblebundle.com
  2.Writes it to a .txt file
  3.Looks up for some keywords which tell if there are free games or no
  4.Prints out the result

<b>You can put this file into your startup folder to have a popup window when your computer starts.</b>
  1.Hold Windows button + R
  2.Type "shell:startup"
  3.Place run.py inside the folder
